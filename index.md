## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="janek.jpg">

Hi! My name is Janek.

I'm a Data Scientist/Statistician/Researcher/Open Source Developer/...

Officially I am a Ph.D. student at the [Ludwig Maximilians Unversity](http://www.statistik.lmu.de) in the working group [computational statistics](http://www.compstat.statistik.uni-muenchen.de).

## News

* 08/03/2018: Added a page about my development setup [here](/dev_setup).
* 09/04/2017: I'm in Seattle from June to September, If you want to meet up shoot me a message.
* 09/04/2017: Started this website, but don't expect very much updates here.

## Meetups and Datageeks

I am (co-)organizing two meetups in Munich, the [Munich Datageeks](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/Munich-Datageeks/) and the [Applied R](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/Applied-R-Munich/) user group.
We recently founded a nonprofit organization in Munich, the [Munich Datageeks e.V.](http://munich-datageeks.de/).
Our aim is to encourage data science in Munich and connect industry, community, research and government.
If you are interested in helping with the organization any of the above groups by investing some of your precious spare time, feel free to [contact me](/contact).


## Research

Most of my research is in predictive modeling and general machine learning.
Especially Gradient Boosting (Tree-based, Model-based and distributional), automatic machine learning, Bayesian optimization and machine learning pipeline configuration.

## Open Source Software

I actively contribute to open source development, most projects are R based and can be found on [github](https://github.com/ja-thomas).


Project | Description
--------|-------
[mlr](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr) |  General machine learning framework in R, unified interface for a lot of common machine learning tasks.
[mlrMBO](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlrMBO) | Model-Based optimization / Bayesian optimization toolbox.
[gamboostLSS](https://github.com/boost-R/gamboostLSS) | Framework for boosting distributional regression models.
[autoxgboost](https://github.com/ja-thomas/autoxgboost) | Automatic tuning and fitting of gradient boosting models utilizing both [mlr](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr) and [mlrMBO](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlrMBO). Still in a pretty early stage.
[hyperbandr](https://github.com/ja-thomas/hyperbandr) | General and extendable implementation of the hyperband algorithm using R6.
[compboost](https://github.com/schalkdaniel/compboost) | Model-Based boosting framework in C++ exposed to R.

We also have a [blog](https://www.mlr-org.github.io) for mlr (and mlrMBO), where updates and projects are collected.
