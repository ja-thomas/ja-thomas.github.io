## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="janek.jpg">

Hi! My name is Janek. Yes, Janek is actually my first name and Thomas my surname.

I'm Data Scientist/Statistician/Researcher/Open Source Developer/...

Officially I am a Ph.D. student at the [Ludwig Maximilians Unversity](http://www.statistik.lmu.de) in the working group [computational statistics](http://www.compstat.statistik.uni-muenchen.de).

## News

* 09/04/2017: I'm in Seattle from June to September, If you want to meet up shoot me a message.
* 09/04/2017: Started this website, but don't expect very much updates here.

## Meetups and Datageeks

I am (co-)organizing two meetups in Munich, the [Munich Datageeks](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/Munich-Datageeks/) and the [Applied R](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/Applied-R-Munich/) user group.
We recently founded a nonprofit organization in Munich, the [Munich Datageeks e.V.](http://munich-datageeks.de/).
Our aim is to boost data science in Munich and connect industry, community, research and government.
If you are interested in helping with the organization any of the above groups, by investing some of your precious spare time, feel free to [contact me](/contact).


## Research

Most of my research is in predictive modeling and general machine learning.
Especially Gradient Boosting (Tree-based, Model-based and distributional), high-dimensional variable selection, automatic machine learning and machine learning pipeline configuration.

You can find out more about my research at my

## Open Source Software

I actively contribute to open source developement, most projects are R based and can be found on [github](https://github.com/ja-thomas).


Project | Description
--------|-------
[mlr](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr) |  General machine learning framework in R, unified interface for a lot of common machine learning tasks.
[mlrMBO](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlrMBO) | Model-Based optimization / Bayesian optimization toolbox.
[gamboostLSS](https://github.com/boost-R/gamboostLSS) | Framework for boosting distributional regression models.
[openml-r](https://github.com/openml/openml-r) | R interface to the [OpenML](https://www.openml.org/) project for collaborative machine learning.
[autoxgboost](https://github.com/ja-thomas/autoxgboost) | Automatic tuning and fitting of gradient boosting models utilizing both [mlr](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr) and [mlrMBO](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlrMBO). Still in a pretty early stage.

We also have a [blog](https://www.mlr-org.github.io) for mlr (and mlrMBO), where updates and projects are collected.


## Misc

Except for all this nerdy stuff, I like hiking, climbing, traveling, board games, video games, good beer, whisky, ...

If you want to know anything else just [send me a message](/contact), I'm almost always happy to talk about data related stuff.
